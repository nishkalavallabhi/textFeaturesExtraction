Our Method

From our early analysis of eQTL and expression data we have formed six groups of genes which exhibit similar behavior. These groups have been constructed from three eQTL hotspots (Mla, MlLa and a neighboring bin of MlLa), one group of genes whose association transfer from MlLa at 16 HAI to Mla at 32 HAI, and finally two groups of genes which display distinct transcript pattern (PacMan and iPacMan). We are interested about the neighboring bin of MlLa since there are 1331 probesets associated with it, greater than the number of associations with MlLa bin. Each of these six groups have an excess of 150 genes associated with them; three of the groups having more than 500 associated genes. Importantly, these patterns of expression mirror specific Bgh infection stages during penetration (16 HAI) and development of haustoria (32 HAI). We have performed de novo analysis and complemented it with targeted discovery to identify CRMs that are present at a significantly higher frequency relative to the background set. De novo CRM discovery have been accomplished using DREME (Bailey, 2011), a discriminative approach that uses beam search with the top-enhanced 100 motifs in a query set of sequences, measuring the motif significance against a negative gene set with the Fisher’s Exact Test. This algorithm then iterates over the list, looking for generalizations of the motifs that can improve their significance. In a comparison done in  (Bailey, 2011) DREME outperforms other motif-finding algorithms both in speed and in the average number of identifiable co-factor motifs found.

Once the set of denovo motifs was reported by DREME, TOMTOM (TOMTOM paper) was used to compare similarity between the denovo motifs and known CRMs downloaded from plantTFDB. For this analysis, only those motifs were chosen whose DNA binding domain of the corresponding Transcription Factor bore adequate sequence similarity to the barley proteome (Weirauch et al. 2014). This analysis revealed a total of <> motifs which were statistically similar to the chosen subset of known CRMs. Enrichment analysis, with the remaining CRMs among the six group of genes against a randomly selected background, revealed <> novel CRMs currently unreported in literature.

To complement de novo motif discovery, we have identified known TF binding sites in our gene sets which tallies with the set of CRMs arrived at from DREME analysis. The recent explosion of validated TF-CRM pairs in plants (Chow et al. 2016, Franco-Zorrilla et al. 2014, Jin et al. 2017,O’Malley et al. 2016, Weirauch et al. 2014, Yilmaz et al. 2009) have been exploited to discover functional CRMs in this targeted approach. Homologous DNA binding domains across different species exhibit remarkable specificity for highly similar DNA sequences (Weirauch et al. 2014), which enables us to translate this information to barley. PWMs from known TF-CRM pairs were downloaded from Plant TFDB 4.0 (Jin et al. 2017) and were used to match highly similar sequences in our gene sets using FIMO (Grant et al. 2011).  

In order to compute motif enrichment, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was carried out with four background sets for each of the six gene sets. The background sets where constructed by randomly selecting sequences from the genome which were absent from the gene set under consideration. Correction for Multiple Testing Error, within each gene-set, was done using Benjamini Hochberg procedure for each background set and each motif. To buttress the enriched motifs revealed by FIMO, Analysis of Motif Enrichment (AME paper) was carried out and the <same motifs was reported to be enriched by AME as well as.>


Together, de novo and targeted identification of putative CRMs will facilitate characterization of cognate transcriptional regulators. By utilizing subsets defined by expression pattern and aligned with Bgh infection stages, we will identify a set of CRMs associated with infection.

As a complementary analysis, the promoter regions will be measured for the presence of CpG islands, which are widely used as a theoretical measurement of DNA methylation (Ashikawa, 2001; Elango & Yi, 2008). Currently, there is evidence that suggest that DNA methylation impacts different plant responses, including disease resistance, by regulating gene transcription (Deleris, Halter, & Navarro, 2016; Domcke et al., 2015; Medvedeva et al., 2014; Orłowska, Machczyńska, Oleszczuk, Zimny, & Bednarek, 2016; Yu et al., 2013). Therefore, the identification of differences in the enrichment of CpG content in the promoters can be used as an indicator of gene expression regulation. This analysis can be used to detect differences in the CpG content patterns in the promoter candidates after the CRM identification, and then tested experimentally through a bisulphite sequencing approach. Preliminary results of Wilconxon rank sum tests show differences in the CpG content of the gene sets when compared with a random negative set (except for the Pacman and the transfer datasets), which indicate that inside these groups there can be subsets of promoters that can be subjected to DNA methylation.
